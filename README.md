I think the time has come to begin [leaving GitHub behind](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/). I'm more active [on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/joelkp), but I still check GitHub notifications.

My [personal website](https://joelkp.frama.io) has more on my projects and interests, and also points to some further places where you'll find me.
